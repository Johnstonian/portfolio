					<p class="about-copy">I'm a full stack developer who loves the web. I'm passionate about semantic and standards based development. Efficient code, intuitive user experiences, and pushing CSS3 standards really knock my socks off. <!-- I'm excited about the future of the web and strive to make it a better experience every day. --></p>

					<p class="about-copy">Like many, I started with web development in the world of Geocities and Angelfire. My latest work has expanded into the modern web landscape of responsive design and mobile first methodologies.</p>
